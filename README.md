# OSF Import

## About
This repository uses the OSF's API (https://developer.osf.io/) to gather a list of preprints and converts them to a format acceptable by the OPS Native Import/Export Plugin.

You will need an Authorization Token (https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Authentication) to make requests.

More help about the usage can be found by running:
```php
php src/import.php -h
```
